{{% title3 "How We Do It" %}}

We use modern tools and practices to improve how decisions are made and services delivered. When working on projects we use the following guidelines:

<div class="content">
  <ul>
    <li>Design with users, not for them</li>
    <li>Invite participation and work in the open</li>
    <li>Use data to drive decisions</li>
    <li>Start small and continuously improve</li>
  </ol>
</div>
